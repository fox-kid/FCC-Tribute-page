          List of Agatha Christie's life and accomplishements:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Her works put her third on the all-time bestsellers list, after the
            Bible and Shakespeare. Her books have been sold in more than 2
            billion copies, and still counting!
          </li>
          <li>
            While being born in an upper-middle class family, she has never
            received formal education
          </li>
          <li>
            Christie is the only crime writer to have created two equally famous
            protagonists: Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple
          </li>
          <li>
            She once disappeared for 10 days and was found in Swan Hydropathic
            Hotel in Harrogate, with amnesia regarding to that event, registered
            under the name of her husband's lover
          </li>
          <li>
            She was shy, disliked loud noices and crowds, gramophones and
            cinema, the taste of alcohol and cigarettes. She was much more into
            the tranquil plesures of life
          </li>
          <li>
            One of her private pleasures was gardening; She has won local prizes
            for horticulture
          </li>
          <li>
            She has wrote and published sixty-six detective novels and fourteen
            short story collections
          </li>
          <li>
            Her stage play The Mousetrap holds the world record for longest
            initial run
          </li>
          <li>
            She has published six romantic novels under her pen name - Mary
            Westmacott. For almost two decades the public had no idea it was her
          </li>
          <li>
            Christie was accussed of anti-Semitic and rasist remarks in her
            works because of depicting Jews and black people with negative
            traits as if they were characteristic to them. Anti-Defamation
            League penned a letter objecting to her apparent anti-Semitism, so
            her agent gave permission to her U.S. publishers to delete any
            distasteful passages about Jews and Catholics
          </li>
          <li>
            She started writing mysteries as a challenge her sister gave her,
            who said she probably couldn't write a good one
          </li>
        </ul>

              was friendly and sharp-witted to meet. By inclination as well as
              breeding she belonged to the English upper middle-class. She wrote
              about, and for, people like herself. That was an essential part of
              her charm.'</em
